# Prime Brokerage Invetory Efficiency and Stock Loan

## Business Problem
### Context
- Prime brokers facilitate the borrowing and lending of stocks. Efficient inventory management ensures that traders and institutions can access securities at optimal rates, reducing costs and minimizing risks.

### Challenges
- **Inefficient Inventory Allocation** → Leads to stock shortages or excess holdings.
- **High Holding Costs** → Poorly utilized inventory increases storage costs.
- **Unpredictable Stock Loan Demand** → Lack of forecasting causes liquidity issues.

### Objectives
- **Analyze Inventory Efficiency** → Track turnover, utilization, and holding costs.
- **Optimize Stock Allocation** → Use Linear Programming (LP) for cost-effective allocation.
- **Forecast Stock Loan Demand** → Implement Machine Learning (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict next-day stock loan requirements.

### Business Terms & Definitions
- **Prime Brokerage** - A service where financial institutions provide stock lending, leveraged trade execution, and risk management to hedge funds and institutional clients.
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio** - 
    - Formula: Turnover Ratio = Sales / Average Inventory
    - High turnover → Efficient stock utilization.
    - Low turnover → Excess stock holding, increased costs.
- **Stock Loan & Borrowing** - Stock loans allow traders to borrow stocks for short selling or arbitrage strategies. Fees and availability depend on supply-demand dynamics.
- **Holding Cost** - Costs associated with maintaining stock inventory, including capital cost, storage, and opportunity loss.

## Technical Design
### Key Technologies
- **Python**: Data processing (Pandas, Polars), ML (Scikit-Learn, Prophet), Optimization (PuLP, SciPy)
- **KDB+**: High-performance data storage & real-time analytics
- **Machine Learning**: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM for forecasting

### Design Patterns Used
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized object creation for different data sources (CSV, KDB+).
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-based notifications for data updates.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable ML models for forecasting.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instance for database connections.

### Python Features Used
- **Multithreading & Asyncio** → For parallel processing of large datasets.
- **Multiprocessing** → To speed up computation-heavy tasks.
- **Decorators** → For logging, error handling, and profiling.
- **Exception Handling** → Robust error control.

### KDB+ Features Used
- **Tickerplant & RDB** → Real-time data ingestion & storage.
- **HDB (Historical Database)** → Stores long-term data for forecasting.
- **Splayed Tables** → Optimized data retrieval.
- **QSQL Queries** → Fast aggregation & analytics.

### Explanation of Key Files
- `csv_loader.py` → Reads inventory & stock loan data from CSV.
- `kdb_connector.py` → Handles KDB+ connection & queries.
- `efficiency_metrics.py` → Calculates inventory KPIs.
- `optimization.py` → Uses linear programming for stock allocation.
- `time_series.py` → Implements forecasting models.
- `logger.py` → Custom logging mechanism.
- `config.py` → Stores all configuration settings.
